<h2><a id="touchkeyboard" href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/using-touch-keyboard/">How to use the touch keyboard</a></h2>
<p>You can use different keyboards with Windows to fit your needs. The most common is a physical, external keyboard that you plug into your <abbr>pc</abbr>. Windows 8 and Windows RT also include a <strong>touch keyboard</strong> for <abbr>pc</abbr>s with touch.</p>

<p><em>Watch a video about <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/using-touch-keyboard/">using the touch keyboard</a> (<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/using-touch-keyboard/">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/using-touch-keyboard/</a>).</em></p>
<p>To use the touch keyboard, tap in a text field or other area where you can type. The keyboard appears automatically.</p>
<figure>

  <figcaption>The touch keyboard</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In some places that you type, the touch keyboard suggests words so you can correct misspellings with a tap. And, the keyboard layout automatically adjusts to the language you choose for Windows.</p>
<p>If you're using a tablet, you might want to switch to the <strong>thumb keyboard</strong>, which splits the keys on either side of the screen, making it easier and more comfortable to use.</p>
<div class="note"><p><strong class="block">Note:</strong> The thumb keyboard might not be available in all languages.</p></div>
<figure>
  <img src="i/image033.jpg" alt="The thumb keyboard" />
  <figcaption>The thumb keyboard</figcaption>
</figure>
<div class="note"><p><strong class="block">Tip:</strong> Here are a few tips when you're using the touch keyboard:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>• Switch between the touch keyboard and thumb keyboard by tapping the keyboard icon in the lower-right corner of the keyboard.</li>
    <li>• Close the keyboard by tapping outside the text box or by using the keyboard icon.</li>
    <li>• Use keyboard shortcuts by tapping the Ctrl key and then tapping another key.</li>
    <li>• Turn Caps Lock on and off by double-tapping the Up Arrow key.</li>
    <li>• Automatically insert a period by double-tapping the Spacebar.</li>
    <li>• If you're looking for some fun characters, tap the Emoticon key.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>If you want to open the touch keyboard manually (without tapping in a text field or other area where you can type), here's how:</p>
<ol>
  <li>1. Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap <strong>Settings</strong>. (If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click <strong>Settings</strong>.)</li>
  <li>2. Tap the <strong>Keyboard</strong> icon.</li>
  <li>3. Tap <strong>Touch keyboard and handwriting panel</strong>.</li>
