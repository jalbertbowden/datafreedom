        <h2><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/customize">Personalize your <abbr>pc</abbr></a></h2>
        <p>If you spend a lot of time using your <abbr>pc</abbr>, you can make it reflect who you are and what you care about. Make yourself at home on the Start screen and arrange it to your liking. Create tiles for your favorite people or websites and drag them anywhere you want—or put similar tiles in their own group. Pin your favorite apps to the Start screen and remove the ones you don't use. You can even change the background and color on your Start screen to match your mood.</p>
        <p>With Windows, you can make your <abbr>pc</abbr> your own.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/change-backgrounds-pictures#1TC=t1">Change your background, colors, and account picture</a></h2>
        <p>In Windows 8 and Windows RT, there are a few new places to show your favorite pictures and colors. On the Start screen, you can change the background and color. The background shows up only on Start, but the color you pick shows up in a few other places too, like the charms and the sign-in screen. You can also make sure there's a favorite photo waiting to greet you on your lock screen, and choose a few apps to show you info and updates you might have missed while your <abbr>pc</abbr> was locked. And you can add some excitement to your account picture — if you have a webcam, you can create a video clip to use instead of a photo. Or if you have photo editing apps, you can use them to add some finishing touches to a photo.</p>
        <p>Here's how to try out these new picture and color options:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>1. Open the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/charms#1TC=t1" title="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/charms#1TC=t1">Settings charm</a>, and then tap or click <strong>Change <abbr>pc</abbr> settings</strong>.</li>
          <li>2. Tap or click <strong>Personalize</strong>, and then change the options you want.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 class="tableheader">Themes and desktop backgrounds</h3>
        <p>All of the personalization settings you know and love are still here too, and you can still use them to personalize your desktop.</p>
        <p>Here's how to check out the brand <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/personalization-gallery" title="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/personalization-gallery">new themes and desktop backgrounds</a>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>• Open the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/charms/" title="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/charms/">Search charm</a>, enter <strong>personalization</strong>, and then tap or click <strong>Settings</strong>.</li>
          <li>• Tap or click <strong>Personalization</strong>.</li>
          <li>• If you don't see something you like, you can download more themes, or even <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/get-started-with-themes" title="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/get-started-with-themes">create your own</a>, from this <br /> same place.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/shared-start-screen#1TC=t1">Customize the Start screen</a></h2>
        <p>Just like you had a Start menu in Windows 7, you have a Start screen in Windows 8 and Windows RT. It has all of the info you care about in one place. You can just glance at the tiles to get the latest headlines, real-time updates, and info, or you can open apps, websites, contacts, and folders.</p>
        <p>Here are the quickest ways to get to Start:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>• <strong>With touch</strong>, swipe in from the right edge of your screen, and then tap <strong>Start</strong>.</li>
          <li>• <strong>With a mouse</strong>, move your pointer to the upper-right or lower-right corner, and then move it up or down and click<strong>Start</strong>. (Or, point to the lower-left corner, and click Start when it appears.)</li>
          <li>• <strong>With a keyboard</strong>, press the Windows logo key <img class="imginline icon" src="i/icon-windows-logo-button.jpg" alt="Windows Logo Button Icon" />.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So arrange Start any way you want it, and put your favorite apps, people, and websites front and center. Here are a few options you can try.</p>
        <h3 class="tableheader">Create tiles for your favorite people and places</h3>
        <p>A tile is an app or content (like a website, contact, or folder) that you can open from the Start screen. So if you have a website that you visit every day or people that you chat with all the time, you might want to create tiles for them on Start so you can get to them quickly.</p>
        <p>When you come across a website, contact, or folder that you want to add to Start, here's how:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>• To pin a website or contact from an app, open the<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/app-commands" title="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/app-commands">app commands</a> and tap or click <strong>Pin to Start</strong>.</li>
          <li>• To pin a folder, open it in <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/files-folders-windows-explorer/" title="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/files-folders-windows-explorer/">File Explorer</a>, press and hold or right-click it, and then tap or click <strong>Pin to Start</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="tableheader">Pin or unpin apps</h3>
        <p>Some apps that are installed on your <abbr>pc</abbr> might not be pinned to Start. But you can always pin them if you want them there. On the Start screen, open the<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/charms/" title="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/charms/">Search charm</a>, select the app you want to pin to open its<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/app-commands/" title="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/app-commands/">commands</a>, and then tap or click <strong>Pin to Start</strong>.</p>
        <p>And if there are apps you don't use, you can unpin them from Start. On the Start screen, select an app to open its<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/app-commands/" title="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/app-commands/">commands</a>, and then tap or click <strong>Unpin from Start</strong>. If you unpin an app, it's still installed on your <abbr>pc</abbr>, so you can always find it again with the Search charm.</p>
        <h3 class="tableheader">Rearrange and resize tiles</h3>
        <p>To move a tile, drag it up or down, and then drag it anywhere you want it. (You don't need to press and hold.) You can arrange the tiles any way you want. Put similar tiles together, group all your favorites, or create a "Work" group for the apps for your job.</p>
        <p>Here's how to name a group of tiles:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>• Touch the Start screen with two or more fingers, and then pinch them toward each other to zoom out. (If you're using a mouse, click the<strong>Zoom</strong>  <img class="imginline icon" src="i/zoom-button-icon.jpg" alt="Zoom Button Icon" />.)</li>
         <li>• Select the group of tiles you want to name, and then tap or click <strong>Name Group</strong>.</li>
         <li>• If a tile isn't fitting in the spot you want, you can make it larger or smaller. Just select the tile on the Start screen to open the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/app-commands#1TC=t1" title="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/app-commands#1TC=t1">app commands</a> and then tap or click <strong>Larger</strong> or <strong>Smaller</strong>. (Some tiles can't be resized.)</li>
       </ul>
       <h2><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/rearrange-tiles-start/">Rearranging tiles on Start</a></h2>
       <p>In Windows 8 and Windows RT, you have lots of options to help you set up Start in a way that's right for you. You can create groups, show updates on tiles, and move tiles around for better access to your favorite people, websites, and more. Or, you can create a simple Start with just a few choices. Take a few minutes to move and resize tiles to see what works best for you.</p>

<h2><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/get-started-with-themes/" title="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/get-started-with-themes/">Get started with themes</a></h2>
<p>In Windows, you can use themes to help make your desktop feel a little more like your own. Themes change the desktop background, window border color, sounds, and screen saver on your <abbr>pc</abbr> all at once, and you can switch between themes as often as you like. You can also create your own themes, and share them with friends <br /> and family.</p>
<h3 class="tableheader">What's a theme?</h3>
<p>A theme is a combination of pictures, colors, and sounds. Themes include:</p>
<img src="i/pieces-of-a-theme.jpg" alt="Parts of a Theme" />
<p><em>Parts of a theme</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>• <strong>A desktop background</strong>. A picture, color, or design that acts as a backdrop to the open windows on your desktop. The desktop background can be a single picture or a slide show. You can choose from the desktop background pictures that come with Windows, or you can use your own pictures.</li>
  <li>• <strong>A window border color</strong>. The color of your window borders and taskbar. A theme can include one specific window border color, or a color can be chosen automatically based on the colors in the desktop <br /> background picture.</li>
  <li>• <strong>Sounds</strong>. A collection of related sounds that you hear when events happen on your <abbr>pc</abbr>. An event can be an action that you do, like signing in to your <abbr>pc</abbr>, or something that your <abbr>pc</abbr> does, like letting you know when you get a new email.</li>
  <li>• <strong>A screen saver</strong>. A moving picture or pattern that appears on your <abbr>pc</abbr> screen when you haven’t used the mouse or keyboard for a certain period of time. The screen saver is turned off in the themes that come with Windows, but you can turn it on and add one to a theme. For more info about screen savers, see <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/using-screen-savers/" title="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/using-screen-savers/">How to use screen savers</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find all of your themes in Personalization in Control Panel. Tap or click any theme to apply it to <br /> your desktop.</p>
<p>Open Personalization by swiping in from the right edge of the screen, tapping <strong>Search</strong> (or if you're using a mouse, pointing to the upper-right corner of the screen, moving the mouse pointer down, and then clicking <strong>Search</strong>), entering <strong>Personalization</strong> in the search box, tapping or clicking <strong>Settings</strong>, and then tapping or clicking <strong>Personalization</strong>.</p>
<p>In Personalization in Control Panel, there are four types of themes.</p>
<ul>
  <li>• <strong>My Themes</strong>. Themes that you've created, made changes to, saved, or downloaded. Any time you change a theme, the new settings appear here as an unsaved theme.</li>
  <li>• <strong>Windows Default Themes</strong>. Windows themes you can use to personalize your <abbr>pc</abbr>. Most of them include a desktop background slide show.</li>
  <li>• <strong>Installed Themes</strong>. Themes that were created by your <abbr>pc</abbr> manufacturer or other non-Microsoft providers.</li>
  <li>• <strong>High Contrast Themes</strong>. Themes that make items on your screen easier to see. The High Contrast themes don't include automatic window border colors or desktop background slide shows.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="tableheader">Creating themes</h3>
<p>You’re not limited to the themes that come with Windows—you can create customized themes using your own pictures and screen savers, and choose the colors and sounds that go along with them. To get started, tap or click any theme to apply it to your desktop. Then change each part of the theme until the desktop background, window border color, sounds, and screen saver are just how you want them to be. All of your changes will be saved under My Themes as an unsaved theme.</p>

      <li>This setting shows each window as an individual, labeled button. When the taskbar becomes crowded, apps with multiple open windows collapse into a single app button. Tap or clicking the button displays a list of the windows that are open.</li>
      <li><strong>− Never combine</strong></li>
      <li>This setting shows each window as an individual, labeled button, and never combines them, no matter how many windows are open. As more apps and windows open, buttons get smaller, and eventually the buttons will scroll.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>3. To use small taskbar button icons, select the <strong>Use small taskbar buttons</strong> check box. To use large icons, clear the check box.</li>
  <li>4. Tap or click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>

<h2><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/how-connect-multiple-monitors">Connect multiple monitors to your <abbr>pc</abbr></a></h2>
<p>Connecting another monitor to your laptop or desktop is a great way to get the best out of your <abbr>pc</abbr>. You can use one monitor for work (programming, files, work email) and the other for play (chatting with friends, social updates, or movies).</p>
<h3 class="tableheader">Connect another screen to your <abbr>pc</abbr></h3>
<ul>
  <li>• To connect a monitor to your desktop <abbr>pc</abbr>, use a video card that has two DVI (or VGA) ports—most <abbr>pc</abbr>s today do, and most flat panel monitors have a matching port. If you have a video card with two ports, you can usually just plug two monitors into the matching ports. Look on the back of your desktop <abbr>pc</abbr> for the video ports, and match the cable from each monitor to the corresponding port. These ports connect directly to your video card.</li>
  <li>• If you have a laptop or tablet, plug a monitor into the <abbr>pc</abbr>’s DVI, VGA, or HDMI port, and Windows 8 will automatically detect the monitor.</li>
</ul>
<p>In both cases, you might need an adapter to plug a DVI cable into a VGA port or vice versa.</p>
    <div class="note"><p><strong class="block">Note:</strong> If you have a video card with only one port, some <abbr>pc</abbr> makers include custom monitor cables that split the signal from one port to two monitors.</p></div>
<h3 class="tableheader">Set up your screens</h3>
<p>Once you plug in your screen, you can choose your display options. To do that:</p>
<ol>
  <li>1. Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap <strong>Devices</strong>. <br /> (If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click <strong>Devices</strong>.)</li>
<li>2. Tap or click <strong>Second screen</strong> and then choose one of these options:
    <ul class="subsomething">
      <li>− <strong>Duplicate</strong>. You’ll see the same things on both screens.</li>
      <li>− <strong>Extend</strong>. Your screen is now spread over two monitors, and you can drag and move items between <br /> the two.</li>
      <li>− <strong>Second screen only</strong>. You’ll see everything on the connected screen, and the other one will remain blank.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
       </ol>
