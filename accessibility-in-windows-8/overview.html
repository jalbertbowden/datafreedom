        <p>The built-in assistive technologies in Windows 8 work with both Windows 8 applications and with desktop software to provide seamless access to the entire Windows experience.</p>
        <p>Devices running Windows 8 Professional will also allow you to use assistive technology (AT) software from specialty <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/enable/at/" title="http://www.microsoft.com/enable/at/">Assistive Technology vendors</a> (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/enable/at/">http://www.microsoft.com/enable/at/</a>).</p>
        <h3 class="tableheader" id="whatsnew">What’s new in Windows 8 accessibility</h3>
        <p>One of the most exciting aspects of Windows 8 is the introduction of touch-only devices. With touch devices, you can directly interact with everything on your screen by touch, without using a keyboard or mouse, including managing accessibility options in the Ease of Access Center.</p>
        <p>With Windows 8 you can easily access the most commonly used accessibility options right from the sign-in screen. Select the <strong>Ease of Access</strong> button <img class="imginline icon" src="i/icon-ease-of-access.jpg" alt="Ease of Access Button Icon" /> in the lower-left corner of your screen, or press the <strong>Windows logo key+U</strong>, to choose the settings for your PC that you want to have available each time it starts. Learn more in the Ease of Access section below.</p>
        <h3 class="tableheader" id="narrator">Narrator and touch-enabled devices</h3>
        <p>Narrator, a basic screen reader that reads aloud the text that appears on screen, and describes events such as error messages, has been redesigned in Windows 8 to be substantially faster, and to support many new features.</p>
        <p>Whether you’re an individual who is blind, has low vision, or who is fully sighted, you will be able to use Windows 8 from the first time you start your device.</p>
        <p>By default on touch-only devices, Narrator can be launched by simply holding down the <strong>Windows logo button</strong> <img class="imginline icon" src="i/icon-windows-logo-button.jpg" alt="Windows Logo Button Icon" /> and pressing the <strong>Volume Up</strong> button. Once Narrator is running, you can use Narrator’s built-in touch commands to explore the screen and control your device.</p>
        <p>There are also some new configuration options for Narrator in Windows 8. You can select one of several voices, change the speed at which Narrator speaks, create customizable keyboard commands, and specify many other settings to suit your preferences.</p>
        <p>Depending upon what device you use, and how you configure accessibility utilities on that device, there are different ways to start Narrator. These are the three shortcuts many people prefer:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>• On the sign-in screen, press the <strong>Windows logo key</strong> <img class="imginline icon" src="i/icon-windows-logo-button.jpg" alt="Windows Logo Button Icon" /> <strong>+U </strong>or click the <strong>Ease of access</strong> <img class="imginline icon" src="i/icon-ease-of-access.jpg" alt="Ease of Access Button Icon" /> button in the lower-left corner, and then choose <strong>Narrator</strong>.</li>
          <li>• On a keyboard, press the <strong>Windows logo key</strong> <img class="imginline icon" src="i/icon-windows-logo-button.jpg" alt="Windows Logo Button Icon" /> <strong>+Enter</strong>.</li>
          <li>• On a touch-only device, hold down the <strong>Windows logo</strong> <img class="imginline icon" src="i/icon-windows-logo-button.jpg" alt="Windows Logo Button Icon" /> button and press the <strong>Volume Up</strong> button.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="tableheader" id="magnifier">Magnifier and touch-enabled devices</h3>
        <p>Magnifier is a tool that enlarges your screen, or portions of your screen, making words and images easier to see. For users with low vision who have trouble seeing their devices, Magnifier makes it easier to see the screen and touch it too.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>If you use a touch-enabled device you can control Magnifier from the edges of your screen. To start Magnifier on a touch-enabled device you first will need to designate Magnifier as the start option when pressing the <strong>Windows logo </strong><strong>button</strong><strong>+Volume up</strong> in the Ease of Access settings.</p>
        <figure>
          <img class="figimg" src="i/ease-of-access-settings-screen.png" alt="Ease of Access settings screen where you can select which accessibility tool to open with the keyboard shortcut Windows logo+Volume Up" />

        </figure>
        <p>Once magnifier has been started on your touch-enabled device, a border will appear around the edges of the magnified screen. You can use these borders to move around the entire screen and it will work with all of your Windows 8 and desktop applications. Simply drag your finger along a border to move Magnifier in that direction. When the border disappears, you are at the edge of the screen.</p>
        <p>By pressing the plus (+) and minus (-) buttons in the corners of the screen, you can zoom in or out to a size that best suits your preference. You can also quickly change the zoom level by moving two fingers closer together or farther apart on one of the borders.</p>
        <p>To help keep track of your location on the screen, Magnifier has a preview feature that shows you exactly where you are in the context of the entire screen. To see the preview, tap with a thumb or finger on opposite borders at the same time. The currently magnified window will zoom out and highlight the part of the screen you are viewing. After a few seconds it will zoom back to the currently highlighted location. When viewing the preview, you can also drag the highlighted region to quickly move Magnifier around the screen.</p>
